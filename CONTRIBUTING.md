# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?
Start a discussion on the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/idarb-oss/F1Telemetry-dotnet/issues).

## Reporting security issues
Security issues should be reported privately.

## Contributing code and content

We accept fixes and features! Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.

* Look at the [documentation](docs/).
* ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/idarb-oss/F1Telemetry-dotnet/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.

### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. 
If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix.
If you are submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the roadmap.
You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza
and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.
All code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap
appropriateness will be merged into the source.
